### Abstract
This paper develops an unbiased Monte Carlo approximation to the transition densityof a jump-diffusion process with state-dependent drift, volatility, jump intensity, and jumpmagnitude.  The approximation is used to construct a likelihood estimator of the parametersof a jump-diffusion observed at fixed time intervals that need not be short.  The estimatoris  asymptotically  unbiased  for  any  sample  size.   It  has  the  same  large-sample  asymptoticproperties as the true but uncomputable likelihood estimator.  Numerical results illustrateits properties.
